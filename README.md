# Python-Capstone-Recipe-Finder
A web application that allows users to search for recipes that they have ingredients for. Currently running on small json file for the search of recipes just for demonstration.

The application allows users to register a user profile, allow the user to login or logout, rate and review recipes, leave notes on what they would do differently, and add their own recipe to the database. 

The users will be able to search for recipes based off ingredients they have in their pantry. The idea came to me one evening when I had a bunch of random left over ingredients in my pantry and I was curious to know if I could make a meal out of what I.
