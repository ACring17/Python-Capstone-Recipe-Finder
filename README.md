## Technologies Used:
* Python
* Flask
* Flask-login
* SQLAlchemy
* WTForms
* Bootstrap

The application allows users to register a user profile, allow the user to login or logout, rate and review recipes, leave notes on what they would do differently, and add their own recipe to the database. 

The users will be able to search for recipes based off ingredients they have in their pantry. The idea came to me one evening when I had a bunch of random left over ingredients in my pantry and I was curious to know if I could make a meal out of what I had left. The idea morphed into a cook book database that will allow the users to search for the recipes that are available with what they have left.  

## Home Screen and Main Search Function
For quick recipe searches for users who do not want to make a profile and want a quick search.
